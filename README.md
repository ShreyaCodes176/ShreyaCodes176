# Welcome!
Hi, I’m Shreya Ghoshal, a BCA student specializing in Data Science, passionate about turning data into meaningful insights and strengthening my problem-solving skills through hands-on projects. 

I enjoy working across both programming and analytics, with a strong foundation in Python, Java, C, and C++, along with SQL for data handling.<br><br>I have practical experience in data visualization and analysis using tools and libraries such as Power BI, Tableau, Excel, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, where I focus on exploring data, identifying patterns, and presenting insights clearly. My GitHub reflects consistent learning through academic work, coding practice, and small projects that reinforce core data science and software concepts.<br><br>In addition to analytics, I have basic exposure to networking tools like Cisco Packet Tracer and Wireshark, which has helped me understand fundamental networking and troubleshooting concepts. I’m continuously building my technical skill set, exploring real-world applications of data, and working towards my goal of becoming a Data Analyst.
